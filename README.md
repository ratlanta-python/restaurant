Sample Python application for the Atlanta Python Geeks of Reddit.

Building

These instructions assume that Python 2.7 is installed, along with `pip`, `virtualenv`, 
and `virtualenvwrapper`. The latter two are optional, but allow installing dependencies
without impact the system as a whole.

1. `mkvirtualenv restaurant`
2. `workon restaurant`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`


Running
